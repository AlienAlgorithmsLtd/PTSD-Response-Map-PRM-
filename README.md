🧠 PTSD Response Map (PRM)
The PTSD Response Map (PRM) is a structured, non-clinical framework designed by Alien Algorithms Ltd® to help individuals visually identify and understand the adaptive patterns of trauma responses in their daily lives.

Rather than focusing on pathology or diagnosis, PRM recognizes PTSD as a form of neural adaptation — a deeply intelligent set of protective patterns formed by the body and mind in response to events that overwhelmed one’s ability to process or escape.

This model helps users trace those response cycles over time, revealing the loops, triggers, freeze points, and disassociation routes that often go unnoticed.

🧬 What Makes PRM Different?
It does not require a clinical diagnosis — anyone navigating trauma responses can use it

It treats patterns as intelligent survival code, not flaws

It’s designed for visual mapping, self-observation, and emotional pattern tracking

It integrates with DPM (Depression Pattern Model) and AMM (Anxiety Mapping Model) to create a multi-dimensional understanding of internal experience

🔍 What You Can Map with PRM
Recurring fight/flight/freeze/fawn loops

Emotional or physiological reactions to hidden triggers

Sensory shutdowns, flashback points, or numbing phases

Behavioral patterns that follow perceived threats, even if subtle

Identity shifts or dissociation markers used for self-protection

By tracing these events, PRM can help reveal where and how your nervous system tries to protect you, even when that protection now causes distress.

🌀 Part of the Self-Mapping Suite
The PTSD Response Map is part of a broader toolkit developed by Alien Algorithms Ltd®:

Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM): A symptom-frequency tracking system to identify anxiety types based on dominant traits

Depression Pattern Model (DPM): A rhythm-based observation model for decoding depressive episodes through pattern cycles

Together, AMM, DPM, and PRM allow individuals to track trauma, anxiety, and depressive responses in relation to each other — giving visibility to what the mind often hides to survive.

👥 Who It’s For
Trauma survivors seeking clarity without reliving events

Mental health supporters looking for non-invasive tools

People who want to understand, not diagnose, their trauma responses

Researchers exploring visual self-assessment tools

Anyone noticing they keep “reacting the same way” without knowing why
