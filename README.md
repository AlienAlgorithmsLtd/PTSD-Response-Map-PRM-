🧠 PTSD Response Map (PRM)

The PTSD Response Map (PRM) is a non-clinical pattern-based framework developed by Alien Algorithms Ltd® to help individuals understand how trauma responses operate as intelligent survival systems.

PRM does not diagnose trauma — it maps it.
It reveals how the nervous system responds to perceived threat, how cycles repeat, where dissociation emerges, and why the body continues to protect itself long after danger has passed.

This model allows users to visually trace internal patterns that typically stay hidden.

🧬 Core Concept

PRM views PTSD responses as adaptive survival algorithms, not flaws or malfunctions.

Instead of asking “Why am I like this?”
PRM asks:

“What is my nervous system trying to protect me from?”

Trauma responses are treated as pattern logic — ancient defensive blueprints still running.

🔍 The Five-Stage Trauma Architecture

PRM maps trauma responses into five distinct phases:

1. Trigger Initiation

Early cues — sensory, emotional, symbolic — interpreted as threat before conscious awareness.

2. Escalation Loop

Hypervigilance, increased heart rate, narrowing focus, and activation of fight/flight/freeze/fawn logic.

3. System Overload

Cognitive bandwidth collapses, emotional clarity falls, survival logic takes over.

4. Protective Dissociation

Identity, sensation, or emotional presence disconnects.
This is not failure — it is the system’s final protective shield.

5. Aftershock & Echo

Residual stress, emotional flatness, delayed waves of emotion as the system tries to “close the loop.”

These stages reveal how trauma cycles repeat even without external threat.

🧠 Pattern Mapping & Internal Logic

PRM highlights the hidden structure behind trauma responses:

Repeating escalation loops

Fork points where the system changes path

Freeze / shutdown nodes

Emotional flash events

Cognitive fragmentation

Physiological echoes

The collapse-and-reboot cycle

These patterns form a survival blueprint, not a psychological defect.

🔄 Energy Flow Model

A simplified interpretation of trauma’s internal movement:

Threat → Surge → Collapse → Reboot

This helps users understand:

why reactions seem sudden

why shutdown happens without warning

why the “after” phase feels flat or disconnected

why emotional rebounds occur hours or days later

This energy model creates a clearer map of internal experience.

🧩 Integration with AMM & DPM

PRM is one part of the Self-Mapping Suite, alongside two other core frameworks:

🔗 Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM)

https://github.com/AlienAlgorithmsLtd/Anxiety-Mapping-Model-AMM

A frequency-based model identifying anxiety types by their dominant symptoms.

🔗 Depression Pattern Model (DPM)

https://github.com/AlienAlgorithmsLtd/Depression-Pattern-Model-DPM

A rhythm-based map decoding depressive cycles through behavioral and emotional phases.

Together with PRM, the trio reveals:

how trauma, anxiety, and depressive patterns intersect

how each state triggers or amplifies the others

the hidden logic your nervous system uses to protect you

👥 Who PRM Is For

People experiencing trauma responses who want clarity without reliving events

Survivors seeking pattern awareness rather than diagnosis

Support workers looking for non-clinical tools

Researchers exploring self-mapping or pattern-system psychology

Anyone who feels “I react the same way every time, and I don’t know why”

PRM makes the invisible visible.

Trauma responses aren’t broken behavior.

They’re ancient blueprints — still running.
